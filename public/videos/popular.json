				"description": "Based on a true American Story. Killers of the Flower Moon, in theaters October.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, oil brought a fortune to the Osage Nation, who became some of the richest people in the world overnight. The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), ‚ÄúKillers of the Flower Moon‚Äù is an epic western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal. Also starring Robert De Niro, Jesse Plemons, John Lithgow, Brendan Fraser, Tantoo Cardinal, Cara Jade Myers, JaNae Collins, and Jillian Dion, Killers of the Flower Moon is directed by Academy Award winner Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Scorsese, based on David Grann‚Äôs best-selling book.\n\nHailing from Apple Studios, Killers of the Flower Moon was produced alongside Imperative Entertainment, Sikelia Productions and Appian Way. Producers are Scorsese, Dan Friedkin, Bradley Thomas and Daniel Lupi, with DiCaprio, Rick Yorn, Adam Somner, Marianne Bower, Lisa Frechette, John Atwood, Shea Kammer and Niels Juul serving as executive producers.\n\nSong: \"Stadium Pow Wow (feat.

				"description": "An overview of seawater desalination: removing salt to make drinkable water from the ocean.\nüí° Go to https://brilliant.org/PracticalEngineering for a 30-day free trial & the first 200 people will get 20% off their annual subscription.\n\nIt might surprise you to learn that there are more than 18,000 desalination plants operating across the globe. But, those plants provide less than a percent of global water needs even though they consume a quarter of all the energy used by the water industry. The oceans are a nearly unlimited resource of water with this seemingly trivial caveat, which is that the water is just a little bit salty. It‚Äôs totally understandable to wonder why that little bit of salt is such an enormous obstacle.\n\nWatch this video ad-free on Nebula: https://nebula.tv/videos/practical-engineering-why-is-desalination-so-difficult?ref=practical-engineering\n\nSigned copies of my book (plus other cool stuff) are available here: https://store.practical.engineering/\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

					"description": "An overview of seawater desalination: removing salt to make drinkable water from the ocean.\nüí° Go to https://brilliant.org/PracticalEngineering for a 30-day free trial & the first 200 people will get 20% off their annual subscription.\n\nIt might surprise you to learn that there are more than 18,000 desalination plants operating across the globe. But, those plants provide less than a percent of global water needs even though they consume a quarter of all the energy used by the water industry. The oceans are a nearly unlimited resource of water with this seemingly trivial caveat, which is that the water is just a little bit salty. It‚Äôs totally understandable to wonder why that little bit of salt is such an enormous obstacle.\n\nWatch this video ad-free on Nebula: https://nebula.tv/videos/practical-engineering-why-is-desalination-so-difficult?ref=practical-engineering\n\nSigned copies of my book (plus other cool stuff) are available here: https://store.practical.engineering/\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

				"description": "The 2024 Aston Martin DB12 ($281,800 in Canada, $245,000 in the US) is finally here and is what Aston calls the world‚Äôs first Super Tourer. The V12 found in the DB11 has been left behind, and in its stead is an even more powerful twin-turbo V8 that makes 671 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. Along with many new updates, such as stiffer torsional rigidity, all-new suspension, and an upgraded infotainment system, does the new DB12 deserve the title of Super Tourer? And how does it stack up against the competition? Thomas and James are excited to find out. We hope you enjoy the episode.

					"description": "The 2024 Aston Martin DB12 ($281,800 in Canada, $245,000 in the US) is finally here and is what Aston calls the world‚Äôs first Super Tourer. The V12 found in the DB11 has been left behind, and in its stead is an even more powerful twin-turbo V8 that makes 671 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. Along with many new updates, such as stiffer torsional rigidity, all-new suspension, and an upgraded infotainment system, does the new DB12 deserve the title of Super Tourer? And how does it stack up against the competition? Thomas and James are excited to find out. We hope you enjoy the episode.
